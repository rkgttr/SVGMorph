#### Build Tools & Preprocessors

**[LESS](http://lesscss.org/)**
Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable. 

**[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)**  
Automates tasks such as minification, concatenation, compression, compilation, browser refreshing etc.

**[Bower](http://bower.io/#getting-started)**  
Bower works by fetching and installing packages from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff you’re looking for.

**[Jade](http://jade-lang.com/)**  
Jade is a terse language for writing HTML templates.

* Produces HTML
* Supports dynamic code
* Supports reusability (DRY)
